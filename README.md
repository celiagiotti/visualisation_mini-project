# Baby Names Mini Project - Visualisation IGR204

This is the repository for the "Baby Names" mini project.

Members of the project group : 
- Laurent GAYRAUD (MS Big Data)
- Alban PEREIRA (MS Big Data)
- Guillaume PIOL (MS Big Data)
- CÃ©lia GIOTTI (MS Big Data)

To do this project, we used Python and coded our visualisations with Altair. Then, to create a more ergonomic and attractive user interface, we used Streamlit (https://streamlit.io). 

In this repository you will find several files of code : 
- visualisation_1.py
- visualisation_2.py
- visualisation_3.py

To view the various visualisations, you will need to create an environment that allows you to run the python scripts from your terminal. Once you have done this, your terminal will issue a command to launch the visualisation interface via Streamlit and open a web page so that you can play with the visualisations.
